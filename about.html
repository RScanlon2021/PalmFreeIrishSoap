            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              A small family business with a strong commitment to sustainability
              and to making a difference by meeting the demand for zero waste,
              plastic-free alternatives to everday
              <strong>soap, shampoo, deodorant & laundry bars</strong>. In
              particular our soaps are free from palm oil, a widely used
              ingredient in the manufacturing of soap. The considerable
              environmental damage caused by the sourcing of palm oil encouraged
              us to develop a safer, healthier, and better alternative to the
              mass produced soap available today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began in 1996 when we were looking for an alternative
              to mass produced chemical-laden soaps for our young family and
              began experimenting with our own recipes for creating a beautiful
              100% vegetable oil-based soap. Our holistic approach was simple,
              using the finest food-grade oils, natural plant-based colours and
              100% pure essential oils.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before long we had the makings of a beautiful handcrafted bar of
              soap that smelt divine. Our initial concept was to offer minimal
              packaging and so we embarked on a "cut it yourself" soap loaf
              which was cut fresh from our unique
              <em>mini guillotine</em> and placed in a simple brown paper bag.
              <strong>Twenty four years</strong> on and we're still offering our
              zero-waste approach. You won't find any 'over the top' fancy
              packaging here, just a visually appealing artisan soap & shampoo
              bar range, still available in our simple
              <strong>brown paper bag</strong> with prices to match. We are
              still the most competitively priced handmade Irish soap available
              today.

            <h2>Our Method</h2>
            <p>
              Today, our method of soap making is traditional and heavily
              reliant on good old-fashioned elbow grease, not only does this do
              away with the need for fancy machinery, it also keeps us all
              fairly fit too. To conserve water usage, we only use
              <strong>fresh rainwater</strong> which is collected in barrels
              before being <em>hand filtered</em> and incorporated into the
              soaps. Using our â€œCold Process" method, the gorgeous
              <strong>vegetable fats</strong> only require gentle heat for
              <em>saponification</em> to take place, therefore energy
              consumption is kept to a minimum reducing our carbon footprint
              even further.
            </p>
            <p>
              We still stir some of our more delicate recipes by hand using our
              original Hand-Crafted Oak Soap Paddle, still going strong after
              over 2 decades of Soap Stirring.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of our product are <strong>100% Vegan</strong> and we are
              constantly updating our recipes and adding new products as we
              continue to grow. We adhere to the strict regulations set in place
              by the HPRA (Health Products Regulatory Authority) and all of our
              recipes are cosmetically assessed, as per European guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              We <strong>hand cut and stamp</strong> the individual bars, and
              are the <em>first company in Europe</em> to give our bars their
              own identity, this is achieved by stamping every single bar with:-
              <em
                >a Batch-Code, a Best-Before Date, The Name of the Soap, plus
                Our Company Name</em
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Range of <em>Zero Waste</em> Products should appeal to
              everyone across the board and makes the perfect Irish gift. With
              growing awareness of the damage and pollution being created on a
              global scale, consumer attitudes are changing and we aim to fulfil
              the demand for a more environmentally friendly alternative.
